Countdown Timer App - Project Report

Objective:
We developed a cross-platform Countdown Timer app using Flutter to help users track important events with precision. The app supports timezone selection, allowing users to view countdowns in their local time.

Implementation:

Core Features:

Add/edit/delete timers with custom names, colors, and exact dates/times

Real-time countdown display with seconds precision

Timezone support (using the timezone package)

Data persistence via shared_preferences

Technical Highlights:

Responsive UI: Adapts to portrait/landscape layouts using OrientationBuilder

Clean Architecture: Separated business logic (timer calculations) from UI

Performance: Efficient rendering with StreamBuilder for live updates

Challenges Solved:

Fixed RenderFlex overflow by constraining card heights and managing text overflow

Implemented intuitive time/date selection with native pickers

Result:
A polished, user-friendly app that handles countdowns accurately across timezones with smooth animations and persistent data storage.
